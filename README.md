# Automated Metadata Extraction for Machine-Actionable Software Management Plan

This project is designed to automate the extraction of metadata from GitHub repositories to generate a **Machine-Actionable Software Management Plan (SMP)**. It consists of two main components:

1. **Backend** - A FastAPI-based service that extracts metadata from GitHub and external sources.
2. **Frontend** - A Vue 3 application providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the backend.

---

## Setting Up and Running the Project

### 1. Running Backend Service
The backend service is responsible for fetching and processing metadata from GitHub repositories and external sources. Follow the instructions in the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) to install and run the backend server.

### 2. Running Frontend Application
The frontend application provides a web interface for users to input repository details and view extracted metadata. Follow the steps in the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) to set up and start the frontend application.

## Running the Project with Docker
To simplify deployment, you can use **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to run the entire project.

### 1. Install Docker
Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install it from [Dockerâ€™s official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### 2. Build and Run the Containers
Navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to build and start both the backend and frontend services:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build and start the **backend** and **frontend** containers.
- Automatically set up communication between the two services.

### 3. Access the Application
Once the containers are up and running, open your browser and go to:
- **Frontend UI:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API Documentation:**
  - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
  - ReDoc: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

### 4. Stopping the Containers
To stop the running containers, use:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

This will shut down and remove the containers but keep the built images.
